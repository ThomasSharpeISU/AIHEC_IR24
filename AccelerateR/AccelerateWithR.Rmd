# Objective

## Scope

- Demonstrate a few examples of leveraging a tool like R to speed up processes.

--

- Highlight key R packages and brief overview of the code flow.

--

- Spur curiosity and ideas.

--

- If you think, "Hey, I can do that better, or I might tweak that a bit." That's Great!
